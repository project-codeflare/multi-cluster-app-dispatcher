                            This field within an item of an appwrapper determines the full state of appwrapper.

                            completed, for instance :- completion conditions could be "Complete" or "Failed".
                            The associated item's level .status.conditions[].type field is monitored for any one of these conditions.  Once all items with this 
                            option is set and the conditionstatus is met the entire appwrapper state will be changed to one of the valid appwrapper completion state. Note :- this is an AND
